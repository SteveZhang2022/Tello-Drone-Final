## Tello-Drone

*This Repository will contain the source code for Tello which is the name of the drone I am going to use for educational purposes. I am working with Python and a few lirbraries to suit the Tello Drone and operate it correctly. I am also learning a little bit more of Python in the process to improve under a short time frame. I am currently using Visual Studio Code as my code editor and I want to mention that the tutorial video I have linked uses Pycharm, which is great too, but I am much more comfortable with Vscode. Plus the installations are not that different too. So I would say, go with what you are comfortable with because these just are tools. I can just get this done faster with vscode*
